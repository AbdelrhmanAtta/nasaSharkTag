### Project Sentinel: You cannot protect what you cannot see. Our mission is to make the invisible, visible.
Every year, an estimated 80 million sharks are killed, pushing ocean ecosystems toward collapse. Current conservation efforts are failing because they rely on static, "blind" protected areas for animals that are constantly migrating.
Project Sentinel is our answer. It's a predictive intelligence platform that fuses NASA satellite data (PACE & SWOT) with a AI-powered smart-tag to create a global, real-time map of shark behavior. Our system doesn't just show where sharks are, it predicts when they will hunt, enabling the creation of proactive, Dynamic Marine Protected Areas that can finally keep pace with the animals they are designed to save.

### The Problem
The annual slaughter of **80 million sharks** threatens ocean collapse. Current conservation methods like static Marine Protected Areas are failing because they are blind to the real-time, migratory nature of these animals. We are protecting fixed points on a map, while the guardians of our ocean vanish.
### Features
**Project Sentinel** is a predictive intelligence platform that fuses NASA satellite data with a novel smart-tag to create a global, real-time map of shark behavior. Our platform identifies not just where sharks are, but uses an AI model to predict where they will hunt next, empowering a new era of proactive, **Dynamic Marine Protected Areas**.
