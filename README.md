# Maritime Orbiters
### Project Sentinel: You cannot protect what you cannot see. Our mission is to make the invisible, visible.
Every year, an estimated 80 million sharks are killed, pushing ocean ecosystems toward collapse. Current conservation efforts are failing because they rely on static, "blind" protected areas for animals that are constantly migrating.
Project Sentinel is our answer. It's a predictive intelligence platform that fuses NASA satellite data (PACE & SWOT) with a AI-powered smart-tag to create a global, real-time map of shark behavior. Our system doesn't just show where sharks are, it predicts when they will hunt, enabling the creation of proactive, Dynamic Marine Protected Areas that can finally keep pace with the animals they are designed to save.

### The Problem
A silent annihilation is unfolding beneath the waves, and our mission is born from the devastating reality of the numbers. In the last 50 years, the global population of oceanic sharks and rays has plummeted by a catastrophic 71% (Pacoureau et al., 2021). This isn't a natural decline; it's a slaughter driven by an industrial scale of overfishing that kills an estimated 80 million sharks annually (Cardeñosa et al., 2023).

This is a global cascade failure. As apex predators, sharks are the guardians of the ocean, maintaining the delicate balance of the food web and even helping to fight climate change by protecting "blue carbon" sinks like seagrass meadows. Their removal triggers a domino effect of destruction that threatens global fish stocks that feed billions of people.

The tragic irony is that our efforts to protect them are failing. We rely on static Marine Protected Areas, fixed boxes on a map, to protect animals that migrate thousands of kilometers. We are trying to build a sanctuary in the path of a hurricane. This is the critical conservation gap we are here to solve. We refuse to let the guardians of our ocean vanish simply because we cannot see them.
### Features
Project Sentinel is a comprehensive, end-to-end solution designed to turn the tide. Our platform is built on a foundation of powerful, interconnected features that transform raw data into actionable conservation.

* Global Predictive Map: Our core feature is a dynamic, interactive world map that doesn't just show where sharks are, but uses AI to forecast where they are most likely to be next and their eating habits along with other data collected from the TAG.

* AI-Powered Foraging Score: We've developed a Random Forest Regressor model that analyzes environmental data to generate a real-time "Foraging Probability Score" from 0.0 to 1.0 for any given ocean region.

* Dynamic Sanctuary Concept: Our platform demonstrates how this predictive data can be used to create Dynamic Marine Protected Areas—intelligent, mobile sanctuaries that adapt and move with the animals they are designed to protect.

* Smart Tag Design: We've conceptualized a next-generation shark tag that uses an adaptive Bayesian Markov chain model to make intelligent decisions about when to transmit data, radically increasing battery life and enabling long-term tracking missions.

* Public Engagement Portal: To win the fight for our oceans, we must win hearts and minds. Our platform includes a dedicated educational portal with an interactive quiz, an e-book, and personal "Shark Tales" to transform public fear into fascination and advocacy.
### Mathematical framework
Our framework is a geospatial data fusion pipeline that uses machine learning to identify environmental niches likely to be shark foraging hotspots. The workflow is as follows:

1. Data Fusion: We fuse multi-source NASA satellite data (MODIS for Chlorophyll/Temperature and SWOT for Sea Surface Height) into a single, unified analysis grid. This is achieved using a cKDTree algorithm for efficient nearest-neighbor interpolation, solving the challenge of mismatched data resolutions.

2. Niche Definition: We mathematically define an ideal foraging hotspot based on a combination of environmental conditions (e.g., high chlorophyll, specific temperature range). This creates a "perfect" hotspot signature that we use to train our model.

3. Predictive Classification: A Random Forest Classifier is trained to recognize this environmental signature. The model then analyzes the entire fused data grid and calculates the probability for each pixel, generating a final heatmap of likely foraging locations.

4. Tag Efficiency (Markov Model): Separately, the smart tag itself is designed with a Markov model. This allows the tag to intelligently decide when sensor readings indicate a significant event, enabling it to transmit data only when necessary to maximize battery life.
### TAG
Our primary innovation is the development of the first conceptualized, non-invasive smart tag that integrates a comprehensive sensor suite with next-generation satellite communication in an exceptionally small form factor. Unlike bulky or invasive alternatives, the Sentinel Tag is designed to provide rich, multi-layered data: including motion (IMU), temperature, pressure (depth), and precise location—while prioritizing animal welfare. Its core novelty lies in its planned integration of the Argos satellite system, moving beyond the limitations of coastal GSM networks to offer true, global open-ocean tracking capabilities. This represents a significant leap forward in creating a viable, long-term, and humane tool for marine research.

This innovation is brought to life through the following key systems:

Intelligent Power Management
The tag's greatest innovation is its power-saving system. Instead of constant, battery-draining data streams, it uses an adaptive Bayesian Markov chain model. This onboard TinyML model allows the tag to learn the shark's patterns and make smart decisions, only transmitting data when significant and noticeable changes occur, extending mission life from months to potentially years.

Rich Sensor Suite
The tag is equipped with a high-fidelity accelerometer and gyroscope (IMU) to capture the subtle movements that define a shark's behavior: the steady glide of travel, the languid motion of rest, and the explosive acceleration of a hunt. This is complemented by onboard temperature and pressure sensors to provide crucial environmental context.

Real-Time Intelligent Satellite Uplink
When the tag surfaces, it connects to satellite networks to upload its compressed data packets to our cloud platform. Furthermore, when the shark is at great depths and satellite connection is lost, the tag stores sensor data in a buffer with timestamps. When the shark resurfaces and connection is restored, this buffered data is transmitted. The location data lost during the deep dive is compensated for by our AI's predictive path model, ensuring a more complete dataset.

Rugged & Non-Invasive Design
The conceptual design is hydrodynamic, rugged, and affixed non-invasively to the dorsal fin to ensure the shark's welfare is the top priority. We cannot protect these animals by harming them in the process.

The current proof-of-concept measures approximately 4×9 cm and demonstrates these key innovations. The final version will be smaller, feature a longer-lasting battery, improved accuracy, robust error handling, and will be fully Argos-enabled for seamless global tracking.

### Sentinel's AI
Artificial Intelligence forms the analytical backbone of our project, enabling predictive insights that would not be possible through raw satellite data alone. We developed a framework of three complementary machine learning models that work in synergy, linking the broad ocean environment with specific shark behaviors to create a multi-layered forecast.

The foundation of our framework is the Shark Hotspot Model, a Random Forest Classifier. This model operates on the fused geospatial dataset created from MODIS and SWOT satellites, analyzing environmental factors like chlorophyll, sea surface temperature, and currents. Its purpose is to identify the large-scale ecological niches that match the mathematical definition of a prime shark foraging hotspot, producing a probability heatmap of likely aggregation zones.

To complement this broad environmental view, we use the Trajectory Forecaster, a Markov Chain model. This model focuses on individual movement, analyzing a shark's past position sequences from tag data to learn transition probabilities. This allows it to estimate short-term trajectories and anticipate where a specific shark might move next within the larger hotspots.

For the highest level of detail, the Tag Predictor Model, a Random Forest Regressor, analyzes the fine-scale movement signatures from the tag's sensors. Since publicly available tagged shark datasets are limited, we trained this model on a synthetic dataset that simulates realistic feeding patterns. This allows the regressor to estimate the probability of specific behaviors, like a feeding event, providing ground-truth context for what the shark is doing at a given location.

This three-layered approach provides a comprehensive predictive picture: the Hotspot Mapper identifies the favorable "neighborhood," the Trajectory Forecaster predicts the likely "street," and the Tag Predictor identifies the specific "action." Together, these models bridge the gap between simulated biological data and real satellite data, enabling us to move from raw information to predictive ecological insights with direct applications in marine conservation and public safety.

### Web Platform
Our web platform is the bridge between our powerful AI and the people who can make a difference. It’s divided into two key areas: the data-rich Dashboard and the story-driven Engagement Portal.

![Home](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AbdelrhmanAtta/nasaSharkTag/refs/heads/main/assets/Home.png?raw=true)

The Sentinel Dashboard: This is the command center for scientists and policymakers.  It features an interactive 3D globe where users can visualize real-time simulated shark tracks, view the predictive foraging heatmaps generated by our AI, and explore the layers of NASA satellite data that feed our models. It's designed to make complex data intuitive, beautiful, and actionable. For real-life use, an ID is needed to view a designated shark, one of the many sharks that are tagged and are monitroed across the oceans.

### Future of the Sentinel
### Sentinel's Tag
The device built during the hackathon served as a powerful proof-of-concept. The following roadmap details our plan to evolve it into a mission-ready, field-deployable device.

Onboard Intelligence: The Leap to Edge AI
To elevate the tag from a simple data logger to a truly intelligent agent, our roadmap includes the implementation of Edge AI directly on the device's MCU. This will enable advanced, real-time decision-making:

* Predictive Dead Reckoning: For periods when the shark is too deep for a GPS fix, the Edge AI will use IMU data to predict and fill in location gaps, providing a more continuous data stream.

* Intelligent Power Management: The onboard Markov chain model will be enhanced to actively manage power consumption, calculating the optimal times to transmit data based on battery level, behavior, and satellite availability.

* Onboard Diagnostics: The AI will run a continuous warning system to detect sensor anomalies or physical damage, ensuring data integrity.

Next-Generation Hardware & Miniaturization
A key goal is to drastically reduce the tag's physical footprint to minimize its impact on the animal.

* Multi-Modal Operation: The tag will feature several distinct operating modes, such as:
    * Working Mode: Normal data collection and transmission.
    * Low Power Mode: Drastically reduced sensing and transmission frequency.
    * Find Me Mode: A special transmission mode to aid in device recovery.
* Robust Error Handling: The new firmware will include advanced error handling to manage data corruption, transmission failures, and sensor malfunctions gracefully.
### Sentinel's AI
### Future AI Model: A Data-Driven Predictive Engine
Our vision is to evolve our current system by applying state-of-the-art AI techniques, including deep learning and computer vision, inspired by their successful use in tracking other marine species.

This next phase will be driven by training deep learning models on large, combined datasets of satellite observations and real-world tagged shark movements from our deployed smart tags. Unlike our current models, these advanced AIs will be capable of learning highly complex, non-linear patterns in the data, leading to predictions with significantly higher accuracy.

The ultimate goal is to expand beyond prediction to support direct conservation action. The future AI will be trained to identify and map high-risk areas where shark habitats overlap with man-made threats, such as plastic pollution and ocean waste. By highlighting these dangerous zones, our work can help guide interventions to protect these vital species and ensure their survival for generations to come.
